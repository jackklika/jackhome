I'm a guy who's interested in technology, chinese, and cooking among other things.

Use the header to check out my blog, and on the bottom of the homepage you can find my linkedin, github, and gitlab. Most of my activity takes place on private repos, so contact me if you're interested in understanding what I'm capable of coding.

Contact me via linkedin or wechat with the id "jklika". If you put a "2" after my wechat ID, that's my gmail email address username.
