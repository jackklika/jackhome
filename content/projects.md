## The Labyrinth [ðŸ”—](https://gitlab.com/uwmcomputersociety/labyrinth-site)
For the [UWM branch of IEEE-CS](http://uwmcomputer.club/), I've written a coding challenge website for members to use to test their programming ability. Instead of using email signup, users are identified by pubkey and answers are submitted using ssh. This has been my most extensive project to date.

## Puppetmonitor [ðŸ”—](https://gitlab.com/jackklika/puppetmonitor)
For CGCA and LSC, I wrote a simple webpage to monitor our virtual servers in pure Go. It was a simple project, but taught me about backend design and how users would interact with the application.

## Wikivoyage [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/User:Jackklika)
When I travel around, I find wikivoyage to be a valuable resource to find lodging, sights, and tasty food. In order to contribute back to the community, I've contributed to various pages about Chinese cities.

## Chantrending
When I was a much younger, I spent a lot of time on 4chan. It's an "anything-goes" site that has had a big impact on internet culture. However with no names associated with threads and posts as well as a hivemind mentality, wouldn't it be easy for advertisers to post company-positive messages and shape board opinion?

This project uses NLTK, PostgreSQL and the 4chan API to track topics over time, allowing to analyze the frequency of certain concepts, and what time these are posted during the day and week. I aim to identify these trends on boards like /tv/, /ck/, and /g/.

This project is currently closed-source, but contact me if you're interested.
