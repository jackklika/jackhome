## The Labyrinth [ðŸ”—](https://gitlab.com/uwmcomputersociety/labyrinth-site)
For the [UWM branch of IEEE-CS](http://uwmcomputer.club/), I've written a coding challenge website for members to use to test their programming ability. Instead of using email signup, users are identified by pubkey and answers are submitted using ssh. This has been my most extensive project to date.

## Puppetmonitor [ðŸ”—](https://gitlab.com/jackklika/puppetmonitor)
For CGCA and LSC, I wrote a simple webpage to monitor our virtual servers in pure Go. It was a simple project, but taught me about backend design and how users would interact with the application.

## Chinese Culture Class Presentations [ðŸ”—](https://library.jackklika.com/share/9P_MOLRc)
During my time at Nanjing University, I took part in a cultural class which required us to present ten presentations over the course of the semester. In the attached folder are the powerpoints for each of these presentations, which cover topics such as BGP hijacking, orthodox Marxist student organizations, Foxconn's move into Milwaukee, and open source software, among others.

## Wikivoyage [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/User:Jackklika)
When I travel around, I find wikivoyage to be a valuable resource to find lodging, sights, and tasty food. In order to contribute back to the community, I've contributed to various pages about Chinese cities.
