      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a guy who&amp;rsquo;s interested in technology, chinese, and cooking among other things.
On the bottom of the homepage you can find my linkedin, github, and gitlab. Most of my activity takes place on private repos, so contact me if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in understanding what I&amp;rsquo;m capable of coding.
This page was generated with Hugo, served with Caddy, and styled with the hugo-coder theme.
Contact me via linkedin, or wechat with the id &amp;ldquo;jklika&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The Labyrinth ðŸ”— For the UWM branch of IEEE-CS, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a coding challenge website for members to use to test their programming ability. Instead of using email signup, users are identified by pubkey and answers are submitted using ssh. This has been my most extensive project to date.
Puppetmonitor ðŸ”— For CGCA and LSC, I wrote a simple webpage to monitor our virtual servers in pure Go. It was a simple project, but taught me about backend design and how users would interact with the application.</description>
